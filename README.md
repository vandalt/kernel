# Kernel

Codes I used to learn kernel phase.


## Bad pixel correction script
For the badpixel correction script, the method used is the one from
[Ireland 2013](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013MNRAS.433.1718I/abstract)
and [Kammerer et al.
2019](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.486..639K/abstract).

The original script is from Michael J. Ireland and was edited by Jens Kammerer
and Rachel Cooper. I also added the bad pixel correction function from
[AMICAL](https://github.com/SydneyAstrophotonicInstrumentationLab/AMICAL) to
compare its results with the fourier correction.
